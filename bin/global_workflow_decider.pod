=head1 DESCRIPTION

A tool for identifying samples ready for alignment, scheduling on clusters, and monitoring for completion.

=head1 NAME

Variant Walling Workflow Decider - SeqWare

=head1 REQUIRED

=item --decider-config[=][ ]<decider_path>

The path to the file containing the default settings for the decider. If another option is chosen via command line option the command line setting will take precedence.

=head2 MAIN

=over

=item --seqware-clusters[=][ ]<file>

JSON file that describes the clusters available to schedule workflows to. As a reference there is a cluster.json
file in the conf folder.

=for Euclid:
        file.type: readable
        repeatable 

=item --workflow-version[=][ ]<workflow_version>

Specify the variant caller workflow version you would like to run (eg. 1.0.1)

=item --bwa-workflow-version[=][ ]<workflow_version>

Specify the bwa workflow required to proceed to variant calling (eg 2.6.0)

=head2 GENERAL

=over

=item --gnos-url[=][ ]<gnos_url>

URL for a GNOS server, e.g. https://gtrepo-ebi.annailabs.com

=item --working-dir[=][ ]<working_directory>

A place for temporary ini and settings files

=item --use-cached-analysis

Use the previously downloaded list of files from GNOS that are marked in the live state (only useful for testing).

=item --seqware-settings[=][ ]<seqware_settings>

The template seqware settings file

=item --report[=][ ]<report_file>

The report file name that the results will be placed in by the decider

=for Euclid
   wait_time.type: integer

=head2 SCHEDULE

=over 

=item --schedule-ignore-failed 

A flag indicating that previously failed runs for this specimen should be ignored and the specimen scheduled again

=item --schedule-whitelist-sample[=][ ]<filename>

This flag indicates the file that contains a list of sample ids to be analyzed.
This file should be placed in the whitelist folder and should have one sample id per line.

=item --schedule-whitelist-donor[=][ ]<filename>

This flag indicates a file that contains a list of donor ids to be analyzed. 
This file should be placed in the whitelist folder and should have one donor id per line.

=item --schedule-blacklist-sample[=][ ]<filename>

This flag indicates samples that should not be run.
The file should be placed in the blacklist folder and should have on sample id per line. 

=item --schedule-blacklist-donor[=][ ]<filename>

This flag indicates donors that should not be run.
The file should be placed in the blacklist folder and should have on donor id per line.

=item --schedule-sample[=][ ]<aliquot_id>

For only running one particular sample based on its uuid


=item --schedule-donor[=][ ]<aliquot_id>

For running one particular donor based on its uuid

=item --schedule-ignore-lane-count

Skip the check that the GNOS XML contains a count of lanes for this sample and the bams count matches

=item --schedule-force-run

Schedule workflows even if they were previously completed

=back

=head2 WORKFLOW

=over

=for Euclid
   thread_count.default: 8

=item --cores-addressable[=][ ]<number of cores>

The number of cores that can be used for the analysis

=item --workflow-skip-scheduling

Indicates no workflow should be scheduled, just summary of what would have been run.

=item --workflow-upload-results

A flag indicating the resulting BAM files and metadata should be uploaded to GNOS, default is to not upload!!!

=item --workflow-skip-gtdownload

A flag indicating that input files should be just the bam input paths and not from GNOS

=item --workflow-skip-gtupload

A flag indicating that upload should not take place but output files should be placed in output_prefix/output_dir

=item --workflow-output-prefix[=][ ]<output_prefix>

If --skip-gtupload is set, use this to specify the prefix of where output files are written

=for Euclid
    output_prefix.default: './'

=item --workflow-output-dir[=][ ]<output_directory>

if --skip-gtupload is set, use this to specify the dir of where output files are written

=for Euclid
   output_directory.default: 'seqware-results/'

=item --workflow-input-prefix[=][ ]<prefix>

if --skip-gtdownload is set, this is the input bam file prefix
